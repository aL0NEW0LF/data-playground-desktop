> [!IMPORTANT]
> This app is still an alpha, which means it got developed to make specific situations and at least a workflow work.
>
> For this version, you will need to place your target column the last column and split the data into training and testing data.

> [!TODO]
>
> - Variance threshold feature selection
> - More plots if possible
> - Better error handling & conditions handling
> - Add training & testing the model without spliting the data
> - Model, metrics & data visualization after training
> - Better UI
